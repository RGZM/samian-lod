<p>This Website provides the documentation to the SPARQL-Query Editor for the <a href="https://www1.rgzm.de/samian/home/frames.htm">Samian Research Database</a>.</p>
<p>The documentation features prefixes, Data & Class maps, example queries as well as insight into the CSV-Data.</p>

<p>As a result of a cooperation agreement between the universities of Reading and Leeds together with the RÃ¶misch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum Mainz, the life-long study made by Brian Hartley and Brenda Dickinson of the stamps and signatures on
    samian became available as a database. They were originally published as a series of books (Institute of Classical Studies, London, from 2008 onwards).

    The <a href="https://www.rgzm.de/samian" target="_blank">Website</a> comprises a suite of databases concerned with samian ware. Their aim is to standardize the recording and publishing of samian ware in such a way that the data is available both
    for comparative identification, and more significantly for scientific analysis using statistical and mapping tools. All have their individual search masks appropriate to the questions likely to require resolution. The databases comprise the
    following:
    <br>
    - Names on Terra Sigillata / Corpus Vasorum Arretinorum (merged into one database)<br>
    - Name marked decorated vessels<br>
    - Ovolo Vessels<br>
</p>
<p>The documentation features prefixes, Data & Class maps, example queries as well as insight into the CSV-Data.</p>
